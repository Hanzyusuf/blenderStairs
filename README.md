# Blender Stairs

Adds a new mesh object to Blender for quickly creating staircases.  Useful for blocking in scenes - or just making stairs without having to fiddle with the Array modifier.

To install, Open Blender Preferences and select the Add-ons tab.  Then click the install button and select the kitfoxStairs.py script.  Finally tick the checkbox next to Add Mesh: Stairs Mesh Generator.  You should now find a new stairs entry in your View3D > Add > Mesh menu.
