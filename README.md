# Blender Stairs

Adds a new mesh object to Blender for quickly creating staircases.  Useful for blocking in scenes - or just quickly making a flight of basic stairs without having to fiddle with the Array modifier.

To install, download this archive as a .zip file.  Then start blender and open your Edit > Preferences.  Select the Add-ons tab and then press the Install button.  Browse to the .zip file and select it.  Finally, tick the checkbox next to Add Mesh: Curved Stairs Mesh Generator.
