# Blender Stairs (Ported for blender 2.79)

## The original blender stairs addon was made for blender 2.8+ which uses python 3.7, this addon has been ported for blender 2.79 which uses python 3.5.

Adds a new mesh object to Blender for quickly creating staircases.  Useful for blocking in scenes - or just quickly making a flight of basic stairs without having to fiddle with the Array modifier.

To install, download this archive as a .zip file.  Then start blender and open your Edit > Preferences.  Select the Add-ons tab and then press the Install button.  Browse to the .zip file and select it.  Finally, tick the checkbox next to Add Mesh: Curved Stairs Mesh Generator.
